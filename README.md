# ACM Problems Solved in Python
This repository contains a collection of Python solutions to ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) problems. The ACM is an international organization that promotes computer science education and research, and hosts an annual programming contest known as the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).

The solutions in this repository are designed to help aspiring programmers improve their problem-solving skills and prepare for ACM-style programming competitions. Each solution is written in Python and includes a detailed explanation of the approach used to solve the problem, as well as the code itself.

The problems are organized by topic and difficulty level, making it easy to find exercises that match your skill level and interests. Some of the topics covered include data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.

To use this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python files to see the solutions in action. You can also contribute your own solutions by submitting a pull request.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their programming skills and tackle challenging ACM problems. Happy coding!
